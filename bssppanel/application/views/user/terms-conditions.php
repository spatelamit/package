                                        undeliverable SMS messages to you because we cannot guarantee delivery of the SMS messages to recipients due to possible
                                        errors. TEAM <?php echo (isset($website_domain) && $website_domain) ? $website_domain : "Domain Name"; ?>

                                    <h2 class="title">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

                                    <P>Whilst we will take all reasonable steps to deliver your messages to recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, or guarantee,
                                        a specific delivery time. Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the
                                        transportation of your messages across the cellular mobile networks.</P>

                                    <p>Furthermore, delivery reports and the originator are operator dependant features and so it is not possible for us to give 100% 
                                        guarantees for their availability. We recommend that tests should be conducted beforehand when these features are considered 
                                        to be of high importance.</p>

                                    <p>You acknowledge that as we send and receive text-messages via major telecommunications companies and Mobile Network 
                                        Operators, our influence over the transmission of your messages is within the technical constraints imposed upon us.</p>

                                    <p>Our responsibility is therefore to ensure that the text-messages you send through the service are processed correctly and delivered 
                                        to the assigned entity. We are not responsible for the final delivery of the message, as this is out of our control and is the 
                                        responsibility of the Mobile Network Operator.</p>

                                    <p>SMS that cannot be delivered within the life span allocated to them, either by us or a Mobile Network Operator will be discarded 
                                        by the Mobile Network Operator, without any notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be 
                                        delivered and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from
